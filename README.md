## React & Redux tutorial - Higher Order Components

A simple example of how to create a higher order component.
In this example a higher order component is created to deal with
authorization (Access control on certain components). Authentication is
achieved through a simple button click.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

App should be up on http://localhost:8080

Running `guard` in a separate terminal will do browser livereload when source changes.
